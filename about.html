  <p><b>Professional</b></p>

  <p>I am currently a Post-Doctoral Scholar in <a href="https://perkelab.wixsite.com/mysite">David Perkel's lab</a> at the University of Washington studying auditory learning and memory and adult neurogenesis</p>
  <br>

  <p>Before that I received my PhD from the University of Maryland School of Medicine where I studied the neurodevelopmental effects of <i>in utero</i> pesticide exposure; I also studied the pharmacodynamics of a potential antidepressant, (<i>2R,6R</i>)-hydroxynorketamine</p>
  <br>

  <p>Before that I received my MS in Forensic Science from Syracuse University, where I was also a General and Organic Chemistry Tutor</p>
  <br>

  <p>Before that I received my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Music from Boston College, where I was also an RA</p>
  <br>

  <p>Before that I graduated from Hazen Union High School in Hardwick, VT</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Personal</b></p>
  <p>I'm interested in many applications of Data Science and AI, including to issues surrounding climate change (<a href="https://climatechange.ai/blog/2022-01-19-methane-reduction">see CCCAI blog</a>) and sabermetrics</p>
  <br>

  <p>When I'm not in the lab or at my computer I'm typically reading, fermenting something, hiking or camping with my amazing partner and energetic hound</p>
