<h1>Eric William Lumsden</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Eric. I'm a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the University of Washington, studying auditory learning and memory as well as adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My website has a couple of purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is, first and foremost, meant to be a place for me to conveniently collate my professional output. Additionally, I intend to explore topics I find interesting and discuss them here (designing this website being one of those interests).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This website will, therefore, be constantly changing and I'm excited to evolve with it!</p>
