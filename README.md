# Eric William Lumsden

Hello, I'm Eric. I'm a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the University of Washington, studying auditory learning and memory as well as adult neurogenesis.

My website has a couple of purposes.

It is, first and foremost, meant to be a place for me to conveniently collate my professional output. Additionally, I intend to explore topics I find interesting and discuss them here (designing this website being one of those interests).

This website will, therefore, be constantly changing and I'm excited to evolve with it!
